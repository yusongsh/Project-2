For this project, I didn't have enough time to put every single player on the 75 Anniversary Team into a more detailed category. Please leave your ideas for different positions with a detailed description of the position you'd love to see in the future. I will try my best to update the <strong>'VIEW BY POSITION'</strong> page as often as I can base on your feedback. Thanks again for checking out this project! 🫠🫠🫠 </p>
